MatchZy is a plugin for CS2 for running and managing practice/pugs/scrims/matches with easy configuration!

## What can MatchZy do?
MatchZy can solve a lot of match management requirements. It provides basic commands like `!ready`, `!unready`, `!pause`, `!unpause`, `!tac`, `!stop`, etc, provides matches stats, and much more!

**Feature highlights:**
- Practice Mode with `.bot`, `.spawn`, `.ctspawn`, `.tspawn`, `.nobots`, `.clear`, `.exitprac` and many more commands!
- Warmup with infinite money ðŸ¤‘
- Knife round (With expected logic, i.e., team with most players win. If same number of players, then team with HP advantage wins. If same HP, winner is decided randomly)
- Start live match (after side selection is done by knife winner. Knife round can also be disabled).
- Automatically starts demo recording and stop recording when match is ended
- Coaching system - **We can't confirm that it works**
- Damage report after every round
- Support for round restore (Currently using the vanilla valve's backup system)
